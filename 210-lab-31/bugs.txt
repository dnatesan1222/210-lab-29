Bugs:

1. holder = customer + ""; --> does not convert to int to string. must update so it converts using to_string()

2. Q4 is showing up as Q0 - update the display() and include the year in the updates

3. waiting time is odd - changing it so there is a short wait after the changes are displayed then a longer wait after the entire quarter results are dispalyed

4. the alignment of the number are slightly off - coding to use setw for display()

5. removing "(wireframe)" from the end of simulation message

6. alignment is almost perfect, fline of item, customers, and profits are slightly off - had to use "<< endl;" instead of "\n"

7. display() only prints based on whether a menu item exist, but we want it to print all customer and profits even if there are more in those lists than the menu items list (edit the while loop conditions)

8. random numbers were not properly being calculated - bug was fixed by adding "srand(time(0));" to the beginning of the main function

9. alignment for the city locations in the display() was odd, added an extra '\t' to better center it

10. backInStock function went unused - removed the function to make code cleaner (also removed seasonal functions that went unused)
