Bugs:

1. holder = customer + ""; --> does not convert to int to string. must update so it converts using to_string()

2. Q4 is showing up as Q0 - update the display() and include the year in the updates

3. waiting time is odd - changing it so there is a short wait after the changes are displayed then a longer wait after the entire quarter results are dispalyed

4. the alignment of the number are slightly off - coding to use setw for display()
